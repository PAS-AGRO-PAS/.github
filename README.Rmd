## Project Objective

The **PAS-AGRO-PAS project** aims to enhance productivity, adaptiveness, sustainability, and profitability of agro-pastoral systems across eight Mediterranean countries. This goal will be achieved through a systemic approach that leverages the multifunctionality of resilient agro-pastoralism.

## Systemic Approach

The project's systemic approach involves an integrated evaluation from farm to global scales. This evaluation interlinks agro-ecosystem, socioeconomic components, and information systems to identify and overcome the stressors that impact the viability of agro-pastoralists. The overarching aim is to implement strategies that transition agro-pastoralism from fragile, subsistence-oriented systems to resilient, climate-adaptive, and more commercially oriented systems.

### Multifunctionality of Agro-Pastoralism

Multifunctionality refers to the broad range of goods and services, beyond food production, that this project will address. These include:

- Maintenance of natural rangelands
- Renewal of vegetation
- Preservation of ecological integrity
- Protection of endangered breeds
- Valorization of typical products and quality certifications
- Safeguarding of tacit knowledge on local ecosystems, flock management, and rangeland practices

## Research Network

The project will investigate a network of ten agro-pastoral systems located in the Mediterranean and Atlantic biogeographical regions of Europe, as well as in the arid and semi-arid regions of Northern Africa. These systems will undergo characterization, diagnostics, strategy design, data analysis, and multi-actor knowledge exchange involving agro-pastoralists, decision-makers, and researchers.

## Specific Objectives

The six specific objectives (SO) of the PAS-AGRO-PAS project are:

1. **SO1**: Evaluate and monitor selected agro-pastoral production systems. This includes assessing resources use, crops, forage, pasture, rangeland, soil fertility, ecosystem services, animal husbandry, food commercialization, socioeconomic factors, and traditional knowledge. The goal is to identify constraints and inform strategies for optimizing resources, improving productivity, climate adaptiveness, and sustainability.

2. **SO2**: Improve the management and diversification of crop and pasture production. This objective focuses on enhancing crop yield and quality, soil fertility, and animal feed availability in the short term, while rehabilitating rangelands and reducing vulnerabilities to climate and land use changes in the long term. Strategies include alley cropping, integrating forage legumes into cereal crop rotations, vineyard and orchard grazing, and using biodiverse pastures and drought-tolerant forage.

3. **SO3**: Increase the productivity of local breeds by better managing diversified feeding systems based on grazing, feeding cycles, herd mobility, reproduction, and health. The goal is to create efficient and sustainable livestock systems, preserve endangered breeds, and build adaptiveness to climate change.

4. **SO4**: Add value to agro-pastoral food products by enhancing quality, safety, and typicity, and innovate selected food products. This involves providing technical support to agro-pastoralists, increasing their income, raising consumer awareness, and laying the groundwork for quality certifications and novel product development based on consumer feedback.

5. **SO5**: Raise the economic potential and generational renewal of agro-pastoralism through product diversification, proper valuation and pricing of food products, improved market access, fostering economic interactions with cultivators, and capacity building via smart platforms.

6. **SO6**: Promote the transition of traditional agro-pastoralism to the "Agriculture 4.0" era. This includes developing networked data collection systems, providing real-time information on traceability, resource use efficiency, and emissions, and creating web apps and platforms. All these will be developed through a multi-actor co-creation process integrating traditional ecological and scientific knowledge to support evidence-based quick reactions by agro-pastoralists and informed decision-making by policymakers.
