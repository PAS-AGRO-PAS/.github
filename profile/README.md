## The Making of Fragile Agro-ecosystems Productive, Adaptive and Sustainable: Multifunctional Agro-pastoralism

This repository gathers all outputs produced by the PRIMA EU-funded project: [The Making of Fragile Agro-ecosystems Productive, Adaptive and Sustainable: Multifunctional Agro-pastoralism (PAS-AGRO-PAS)](https://prima-med.org/what-we-do/years/funded-projects-2022/).

The [PAS-AGRO-PAS GitHub community [https://github.com/vcadavez/PAS-AGRO-PAS](https://github.com/PAS-AGRO-PAS/.github/)(https://github.com/PAS-AGRO-PAS/.github/) involves protocols, technical and scientific articles, and datasets on:

*  Agro-pastoral production systems;
*  Management and diversification of crop and pasture production;
*  Productivity of livestock local breeds;
*  Raise the economic potential and generational renewal of agro-pastoralism; and
*  Promote the transition of traditional agro-pastoralism to the `Agriculture 4.0`.
