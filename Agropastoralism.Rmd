## Introduction

Agro-pastoralism is a traditional form of territorial management in marginal areas of the Mediterranean region that supports food security and livelihood for thousands of families. It generates employment and income, and has proven to be an effective land use strategy for mountains, dry lands, and islands that cover approximately half of the Euro-Mediterranean region [@FAO2020].

However, modern agro-pastoralism faces significant unpredictability and risks, not only from ecological and climate change factors but also from political, commercial, and administrative stressors. At the production level, agro-pastoral farms suffer from structural and institutional deficiencies, including low productivity, high production costs due to limited feed production, changes in land use, abandonment, population aging, and inadequate marketing [@Nori2017]. These interrelated problems require solutions that leverage the multifunctionality of agro-pastoralism and improve productivity, adaptiveness, and sustainability through a systemic approach.

## Climate Change and Agro-Pastoralism

While climate change poses a serious threat to agro-pastoral systems, agro-pastoralism itself is a valuable asset in combating climate change. This is achieved through the implementation of climate-smart agricultural interventions that enhance resilience and ecological intensification [@Kgosikoma2018]. Despite the challenges, agro-pastoral products and services, such as organic production, biodiversity, ecosystem services, landscape and culture, and quality foods, have become increasingly valued by society. A growing number of consumers are more attracted to traditional foods from natural systems than those from intensive production methods. The willingness of consumers to pay more for quality can offset lower agricultural productivity [@Pardini2011].

## Project Scope

The PAS-AGRO-PAS project addresses "Improving the sustainability of agro-pastoralism in the Mediterranean Region under climate change" by tackling current constraints and the effects of climate change using a systemic approach. The project maximizes the multifunctionality of agro-pastoralism while enhancing **Productivity**, **Adaptiveness**, and **Sustainability** to create more resilient and profitable systems.

### Project Scales

1. **Farm Scale**:
    - **Actions**:
        - Increase productivity and diversification of animals and crops.
        - Improve grazing management.
        - Introduce drought-tolerant forage and crops.
        - Recover degraded pastures by sowing adapted varieties using mixtures of biodiverse seeds to stimulate diverse grasses and improve nutrient cycling and plant productivity.
        - Enhance soil fertility and crop productivity through efficient manure treatment.
        - Protect endangered local breeds.
        - Improve ruminants' productivity through enhanced reproduction and health control, feeding, and nutrition strategies.
    - **Focus**: Environmentally friendly strategies (C, N, overall GHG footprint) that build adaptiveness to climate change.

2. **Regional Scale**:
    - **Actions**:
        - Transmit the implicit value of agro-pastoral products along the food chain.
        - Strengthen quality and safety assurance for typical foods.
        - Exploit the marketable "healthy trait" of foods produced with environmentally friendly methods.
        - Integrate products into markets and consolidate the identity of Mediterranean agro-pastoral communities.

3. **Global Scale**:
    - **Actions**:
        - Address the current lack of information on agro-pastoralism [@FAO2020] by systematizing available data, literature, assessments, research results, models, and web apps. This promotes the transition to "Agriculture 4.0" and informs evidence-based decisions for agro-pastoralists and policymakers.
        - Build capacities among agro-pastoralists to implement more productive, climate-smart, resilient, and profitable systems in the Mediterranean.
        - Raise consumer awareness and promote attractive conditions for local new generations and migrants.
